# Angel Routes

Angel Routes is a toy application created for submission to the Alphathon 2024 competition, organized by the Society of Quantitative Analysts (SQA).

## About the Project

Angel Routes is a proof-of-concept application designed to illustrate potential uses of a high-performance reactive stream processing library called [csp](https://github.com/Point72/csp/). 

The application utilizes the public API provided by the NYC Citibike ride-sharing service to identify opportunities for "bike angels" â€” riders who help balance the bike network. Specifically, Angel Routes identifies situations where a short ride from a nearly full bike station to an almost empty station can help other riders by redistributing bikes. These short trips also generate "angel points" within the Citibike system, rewarding riders who assist with bike redistribution.

While this project is not intended for production use, it serves as an example of how algorithms, reactive stream processing, and public APIs can be used to optimize real-world systems and provide value to communities.
